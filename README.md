# udacicards

This is a project for Udacity's React Nanodgree third phase of React Native. It is a react native mobile app which can be built
for both ios and android. It provides mechanism to create unlimited number of decks and add unlimited number of questions/answers
to any deck. Users can view details of a deck and start a quiz for the included questions in the deck. This app does not talk
to any api server and stores the information locally.
